## mave.io

Integrating video shouldn't be difficult... and why are we still using iframes to embed video? It can be faster, easier and more customizable to give your users a better video experience.

Hey ðŸ‘‹ We're [mave.io](https://mave.io) and we provide hosted video with lightweight components. We're EU hosted and privacy-friendly too.

## How it works

Upload your video on our platform and just use our component to embed a video. Or you can even use the component of ours to upload videos to our platform from your own site! You can choose your own type of integration.

You can read more in the [documentation](https://docs.mave.io).
